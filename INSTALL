To install ATAidle, run 'make' to build, followed by 'make install' to
install the binary into /usr/local/sbin, and install the man page into
/usr/local/man/man8.   If you later want to remove ataidle, simply run
'make uninstall'.   
Alternatively, the binary can
be copied and run from a more convenient location.

Linux Users:  You may have to edit Makefile.Linux to set the compiler 
name - it's currently 'gcc-3.3' because a compiler which understands
C99 must be used, and gcc 2.95 doesn't support it.   Some distributions
such as gentoo use version 3.3 by default and thus don't have a 'gcc-3.3'
executable.  In this case, change 'gcc-3.3' to 'gcc' and run 'make'.
