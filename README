ataidle sets the idle timer on ATA hard drives, so they spin down when the 
period of inactivity has expired.  To use it, you must be running FreeBSD 
with ATAng, so basically FreeBSD 5.1 or newer - alternatively, you can also
run it on Linux - it's been tested with kernel 2.6.1, but should work with
any recent kernel.  It will not work on architectures other than i386, since
it doesn't yet handle endian issues.  Also, it is limited to detecting
the first 8 ATA channels.

Usage: atacontrol [-h] [-l] [-s] [-i] [-I idle_mins] [-S standby_mins] 
	[-A acoustic_level] [-P apm_level] channel device

where

-h		shows usage information
-l		lists installed devices
-I		sets the idle level spindown timer
-i		sets the drive into idle mode immediately
-S		sets the standby level spindown timer
-s		sets the drive into standby mode immediately
-A		sets the acoustic level, value between 128 and 254
-P		sets the power management level, value between 1 and 254

channel	the channel of ata controller
device	the device of the ata controller (0 or 1)

You can find the correct channel and device by listing the installed
devices with 'ataidle -l channel device'

Supplying channel and device numbers without any parameters will display 
information about the specified device.

Notes on AutoAcoustic (AAC) and APM support

Use of this feature is experimental, and may crash your computer - although
it is believed to be stable, it is modifying hard disk behaviour as data is
being read or written, so any fault in the drive could have disastrous
consequenses for your data.

Meaning of various AutoAcoustic values:

0		Acoustic management disabled
1		Minimum acoustic output
2-126	Intermediate acoustic output levels
127		Maximum performance, maximum acoustic output

Meaning of various APM values:

1		Minimum power usage with Standby (spindown)
2-127	Intermediate power usage with Standby
128		Minimum power usage without Standby (no spindown)
129-253	Intermediate power usage without Standby
254		Maximum performance, maximum power usage

Some values may not be supported, in this case you will see an error
message 'Set APM failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device'.
