ataidle sets the idle timer on ATA hard drives, so they spin down when the 
period of inactivity has expired.  To use it, you must be running FreeBSD 
with ATAng, so basically FreeBSD 5.1 or newer.

Usage: atacontrol [-h] [-l] [-s] [-i] [-I idle_mins] [-S standby_mins] [-A acoustic_level] [-P apm_level] channel device

where

-h		shows usage information
-l		lists installed devices
-I		sets the idle level spindown timer
-i		sets the drive into idle mode immediately
-S		sets the standby level spindown timer
-s		sets the drive into standby mode immediately
-A		sets the acoustic level, value between 128 and 254
-P		sets the power management level, value between 1 and 254

channel	the channel of ata controller
device	the device of the ata controller (0 or 1)

You can find the correct channel and device by listing the installed
devices with 'ataidle -l channel device'

Supplying channel and device numbers without any parameters will display information about the
specified device.
