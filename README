ataidle sets the idle timer on ATA hard drives, so they spin down when the 
period of inactivity has expired.  To use it, you must be running FreeBSD 
with ATAng, so basically FreeBSD 5.1 or newer.

Usage: atacontrol -S <idle_mins> <channel> <device>

You can find the correct channel and device from the output of 
'atacontrol list'.   ataidle does not currently do extensive error checking 
for running the commands on channels/devices which do not have ATA drives 
attached.  This should be harmless, and cause it to pause until the 
timeout (100s) has elapsed.  You may get a messages from the kernel about 
a missing interrupt, but from my testing it would not appear to cause 
problems.
